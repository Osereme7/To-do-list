CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery or deployment. It is a set of practices that help software development teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. CI/CD is part of DevOps, which helps shorten the software development lifecycle.

Some advantages of CircleCI over GitHub Actions are:

CircleCI works with private or public repositories stored on Bitbucket or GitHub, while GitHub Actions works with repositories stored on GitHub only. This gives CircleCI more flexibility and compatibility with different version control systems.
CircleCI offers a simpler design than GitHub Actions, using a concept called orbs to provide reusable tasks that people can use in a workflow. GitHub Actions requires more input, including Docker commands, to create similar tasks2.
CircleCI provides greater visibility into workflow status, duration, credit consumption, flaky tests, and costs with its Insights dashboard. GitHub Actions does not have a comparable feature to help teams improve their productivity and efficiency.
